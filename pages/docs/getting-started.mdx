# Getting started

Welcome to the Argos documentation!

To learn about Argos' philosophy, visit [about Argos CI](/about-argos-ci).

**Prerequisites**: to use Argos CI, you need a GitHub-hosted project with [end-to-end tests](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests) and a [CI environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration).

### 1. Install the CLI

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev argos-cli
```

### 2. Install the Argos app on GitHub marketplace

Install the [Argos-ci App](https://github.com/apps/argos-ci) and select the chosen repository.

### 3. Get the Argos repository's token

Argos assigns a unique token to the connected repositories. This token should be added as a CI environment variable and sent when the screenshots are uploaded.

- Login to https://www.argos-ci.com
- Click on your organization's name (or username) to display the repositories
- Select the repository you want to activate and click on `Activate repository` button
- Copy and save the `ARGOS_TOKEN` value. It will be used as a environment variable during the CI configuration.

### 4. Configure your CI to send screenshots to Argos

Use the CI configuration doc that matches your stack.

> Argos has a fast install for some static sites stacks. Visit [static sites doc](/static-sites/) to check if we have an integration for your stack.

### Enjoy!

You are ready to [add visual testing to your routine](/visual-testing-routine/)!
